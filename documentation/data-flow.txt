- player logs in (HTTP)
    if successful, they get their playerId and a token
    - token: must be stored by the client and sent in the auth header of each subsequent HTTP request and as a "token" property in each socket message
- player joins (or creates) a game (HTTP)
    namespace is created (if it didn't already exist) with the id of the game
    message is sent to the namespace of player joining (SOCKET)
- player enters (or creates) a battle (HTTP)
    room is created (if it didn't already exist) with the id of the battle
    message is sent to the room of player joining (SOCKET)

Client generally will not send socket messages to the server, unless we determine at some point that that would be useful/advantagious
All actions initiated by the client are sent via AJAX request to an HTTP API endpoint.
Responses to the requestor are sent in the response to the HTTP request
Game updates to the entire namespace/room are sent via socket messages
