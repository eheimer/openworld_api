# GitHub Issue Integration

## Issue Reference Detection

When the user references an issue number (e.g., "#42", "issue #42", "issue 42"), you should:

1. **Fetch the issue details** using the GitHub MCP server
   - Repository: `eheimer/openworld_api`
   - Use `mcp_github_get_issue` with the issue number

2. **Check for tasks.md file** in the issue body or comments
   - If the issue contains a tasks.md or task list, use it to track progress

## Spec Creation from Issues

When creating a spec from a GitHub issue:

1. **Record the issue number** in the requirements.md file
   - Add a metadata section at the top of requirements.md
   - Format: `**GitHub Issue:** #<issue_number>`
   - This allows tracking back to the original issue when executing tasks

Example requirements.md header:
```markdown
# Requirements Document

**GitHub Issue:** #42

## Issue Progress Tracking

When working on an issue with a task list, follow this workflow:

### 1. First Task Started

When you begin working on the first task:
- NOTE: changing status is not supported with our MCP settings at this time, so ignore this line: **Update the issue status** to "In Progress" using `mcp_github_update_issue`
- Add a comment to the issue using `mcp_github_add_issue_comment`
- Comment should include:
  - Acknowledgment that work has started
  - Complete contents of the tasks.md or task list
  - Format as a GitHub markdown checklist

Example comment:
```
Starting work on this issue:

- [ ] Task 1 description
- [ ] Task 2 description
- [ ] Task 3 description
```

### 2. Task Completion

**MANDATORY**: After completing each task, you MUST:
- **Add a new comment** using `mcp_github_add_issue_comment` with a brief update
- This is REQUIRED and must happen automatically without user prompting
- Comment should mention which task was completed
- Keep comments limited to the task number and one-line description from tasks.md
- Format: `✅ Completed task {number}: {task description}`

Example comment:
```
✅ Completed task 2: Create systemd service for NocoDB container management
```

**When to add the comment:**
- Immediately after marking a task as completed using `taskStatus` tool
- Before stopping to let the user review
- This applies to ALL tasks from specs that reference a GitHub issue

### 3. All Tasks Completed

When the final task is completed:
- Ask the user if they want to close the issue
- Wait for user confirmation

### 4. Closing the Issue

If the user confirms (affirmative response like "yes", "sure", "go ahead", etc.):
- Add a final comment summarizing completion
- this comment can be a brief paragraph summary of work completed.  A lot of detail is not necessary.
- Use `mcp_github_update_issue` to close the issue with `state: "closed"`

## Best Practices

- Always fetch the issue first to understand context
- Don't spam comments - be concise and meaningful
- Only track progress for issues with clear task lists
- If an issue doesn't have tasks, work on it normally without progress comments
- Respect user preferences - if they say not to close, leave it open
