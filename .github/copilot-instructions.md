when generating ts code, do not include the trailing semi-colon
when searching for files, make sure to always go back to the root of the project. For example, searching for controllers in the src folder, make sure to search for /src/**/\*.controller.ts, likewise when searching for tests, search for /test/**/\*.spec.ts. The leading '/' character refers to the root project folder, which is /home/eric/work/openworld/openworld_api
