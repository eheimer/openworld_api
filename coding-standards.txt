--== logic separation ==--

Services should encapsulate the vast bulk of the game logic.

Controllers should be responsible exclusively for receiving and parsing
requests, passing the data off to appropriate services, and parsing and
returning data back in the response

Factories should be used for creating/building entities, as well as mock
data for tests.

Models should contain entity definitions only, no logic of any kind

Repositories should contain database logic for retrieval of records,
associations, etc
