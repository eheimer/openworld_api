# Openworld API Test Client

## ⚠️ AI-Generated Code Notice

**This entire codebase was generated by AI and has not yet been validated by human code review.**

### Current Status

- ✅ **Functional**: The test client works and provides the intended functionality
- ✅ **Tested**: Basic functionality has been verified through manual testing
- ⚠️ **Not Reviewed**: Code has not been analyzed for adherence to project standards
- ⚠️ **Not Audited**: Security, performance, and best practices have not been formally reviewed

### Future Tasks

Before considering this code production-ready, the following should be completed:

- [ ] Human code review for adherence to project coding standards
- [ ] Security audit of authentication handling and API interactions

## Overview

This is a Vue.js 3 test client for the Openworld API. It provides a web-based interface for manual QA testing of API endpoints.

## Purpose

The test client enables QA testers to:
- Authenticate with the API
- Test game management operations
- Test character creation and management
- Test battle mechanics
- Test inventory operations
- View detailed API request/response logs

## Technology Stack

- **Vue.js 3** - Frontend framework (Composition API)
- **Vite** - Build tool and dev server
- **Axios** - HTTP client for API requests
- **Vitest** - Testing framework

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 25.x
- npm 11.x

### Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Run tests
npm run test
```

### Development Server

The Vite dev server runs on `http://localhost:5173` and proxies API requests to `http://localhost:3000/api`.

### Building

The build process compiles the Vue.js application to `../_static/client/` which is then served by the NestJS application at `/client/`.

```

## Integration with NestJS

The test client is served by the NestJS application through the ServeStaticModule:
- **Endpoint**: `http://localhost:3000/client/`
- **Static files**: Served from `_static/client/`
- **API proxy**: All `/api/*` requests are handled by NestJS

## Testing

Unit tests are written using Vitest and Vue Test Utils:

```bash
# Run tests once
npm run test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch
```

## Known Limitations

As AI-generated code, this implementation may have:
- Inconsistent coding patterns
- Suboptimal performance characteristics
- Missing edge case handling
- Incomplete error handling
- Accessibility issues
- Security vulnerabilities

**Use with caution and review thoroughly before relying on this code in production scenarios.**
